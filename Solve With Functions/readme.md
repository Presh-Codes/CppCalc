# Solving Same Problem Using Functions In C++
### In this file I explain what exactly I did in the code I made.
---
**What I changed**:
- Removed unnecessary variable (d) from your code.
- Used functions to make calculations, for code readabilit (because code readability is very important).
- Changed variable names to be a lil bit more specific so other programmers will know exactly what each variable does.
- Eliminated code repition spotted in [Calccode.cxx](https://github.com/Presh-Codes/CppCalc/blob/main/Calccode.cxx)
- Added check for division by zero.
